## 10000 foot view

* [PunC](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/PunCalculus) is an Intermediate Representation
* [Relog](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/InPlace) is a Type System
* [Œª‚ò∂](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/-) is a Compiler Backend
  * Combines PunC, Relog, and a simple S-Expression parser to create a typed fragment assembler
* [LSTS](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/LSTS) is a Compiler Frontend

## 2024 Roadmap

* Bootstrap Compiler ü•≥üéâüéÅ

## My TODO List

* ‚úì Bootstrap Compile a CLI that dumps S-Expression fragments
* Bootstrap Compile a CLI that normalizes then dumps S-Expression fragments
   * ‚úì Atom convenience functions
   * ‚úì Cons convenience functions
   * user-defined functions
   * eval-soft
* Bootstrap Compile a CLI that parses, normalizes, then dumps S-Expression fragments
* Bootstrap Compile a CLI that parses, verifies, normalizes, then dumps S-Expression fragments
* Bootstrap Compile a fast CLI that parses, verifies, normalizes, then dumps S-Expression fragments
* Freeze a "canonical" bootstrap version
