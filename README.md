### 2024 Roadmap (Working towards a verified kernel language)

* ✓ [1.0.0 Bootstrap Compiler](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/-/releases/tag/1.0.0) 🥳🎉🎁
* ✓ [1.6.0 Production Compiler](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/-/releases/tag/1.6.0)
* ✓ [1.10.0 Ad-Hoc Specialization and Hygienic Macros](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/-/releases/tag/1.10.0)
* 100% compiled code in compiler / somewhat stable compiler / somewhat stable language standard
  * ✓ [cli.lm](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/lambda-mountain/blob/main/STRICT/cli.lm)
  * ✓ [tokenize.lm](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/lambda-mountain/blob/main/STRICT/tokenize.lm)
  * ✓ [parse.lm](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/lambda-mountain/blob/main/STRICT/parse.lm)
  * ✓ [preprocess.lm](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/lambda-mountain/blob/main/STRICT/preprocess.lm)
  * ✓ [typecheck.lm](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/lambda-mountain/blob/main/STRICT/typecheck.lm)
  * ✓ [assemble.lm](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/lambda-mountain/blob/main/STRICT/assemble.lm)
  * ✓ [codegen.lm](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/lambda-mountain/blob/main/STRICT/codegen.lm)
  * ✓ [fragment.lm](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/lambda-mountain/blob/main/STRICT/fragment.lm)
  * ✓ [utility.lm](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/lambda-mountain/blob/main/STRICT/utility.lm)
  * [bootstrap the new stable compiler](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/lambda-mountain/issues/282)
* publish [language standard](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/lambda-mountain/wiki/Unopinionated-Philosophy#standards) v1.0

### Upcoming Planned Features

* actually useful errors messages with code snippets and source location (working on strict compiler)
* arbitrary sized return values
* parametric polymorphism
* sub 5s compile times (doing math on S-Expressions instead of integers is slow...)
* back towards 3000 SLOC from current 5000 SLOC (more features means less code somehow)
* metric specialization for data structures (farewell hashmap)

### Request for Comment

If you feel like contributing to either LM or LSTS it would be enormously helpful to have anyone simply read a bit and ask a question. 
The projects are starting to grow to a size where it is hard to understand where a curious learner might get stuck.
Different people have different backgrounds so it takes all shapes and sizes.
Everyone is welcome, though I fear that the learning curves are still very steep.
