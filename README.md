## My Projects

### 10000 foot view

* [PunC](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/PunCalculus) is an Intermediate Representation
* [Relog](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/InPlace) is a Type System
* [λ☶](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/-) is a Compiler Backend
  * Combines PunC, Relog, and a simple S-Expression parser to create a typed fragment assembler
* [LSTS](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/LSTS) is a Compiler Frontend

### 2024 Roadmap

* Bootstrap Compiler 🥳🎉🎁

The bootstrap compiler implements eval-soft.
The compiler will be considered complete when it can be shown that no valid program sent to eval-soft will crash or return a non-normal result.
The one exception to this rule is Stack Overflow, which is a defined behavior with a non-normal result.

### My TODO List

* ✓ Bootstrap Compile a CLI that dumps S-Expression fragments
* ✓ Bootstrap Compile a CLI that normalizes then dumps S-Expression fragments
* ✓ Bootstrap Compile a CLI that parses, normalizes, then dumps S-Expression fragments
* Bootstrap Compile a CLI that parses, normalizes, then assembles input files including itself (actually bootstrapping at this point)
  * ✓ Use `g.lm` to compile and run the whole test suite
  * Use `g.lm` to compile itself, a full featured compiler
    * ✓ --tokenize PRODUCTION/cli.lm
    * ✓ --parse PRODUCTION/cli.lm
    * ✓ Validate full correctness of bootstrap parser against hosted parser (78 / 78 passing)
    * optimize memory footprint of compiler: (current footprint = 50MB of cons cells to parse an 80KB file)
       * call parse-lambda (35 times - correct)
       * call parse-many (2635 times - high)
       * call parse-one (7779 times - high)
    * -o lambda_mountain
* (λ☶ VERSION 1.0) Distribute bootstrapped compiler with `cargo install` instead of hosted compiler
