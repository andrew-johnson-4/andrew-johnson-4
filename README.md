# My Software Philosophy of YES

> If you say *software, allow this*. I say "yes".

> If you say *software, disallow this*. I say "yes".

Despite my desire for my software to be all things to all people, sometimes consequential design decisions are unavoidable.
My software is meant to be a platform that others can leverage to build cool things.
To this end I have committed to a policy of *configuration over code*.
Configuration over code means that whenever possible I will make design decisions configurable opt-in choices.
My software is not meant to be opinionated software.
I want to empower users to build cool things using any methodology that seems appropriate.

Acknowledging the obvious commitments like syntax or semantics. I realize that
few concepts will map one-to-one with my projects structures. However, I will go
out of my way to ensure that there *exists* a mapping from your idea to my
platform.

Do you want different syntax? I will help you build it leveraging my codebase.

Do you want different logic? I will help you build a plugin.

Your project. My logic. Your success. My success.
