### 2024 Roadmap (Working towards a verified kernel language)

* ✓ [1.0.0 Bootstrap Compiler](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/lambda-mountain/releases/tag/1.0.0) 🥳🎉🎁
* ✓ [1.15.0 9s bootstrap compile time (down from 25 minutes)](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/lambda-mountain/releases/tag/1.15.0)

### Reading

* [A Brief Introduction To Programming In LM](https://andrewjohnson4.substack.com/p/a-brief-introduction-to-programming)
* [Most Opcodes Are Typesafe If Memory Is Infinite](https://andrewjohnson4.substack.com/p/most-opcodes-are-typesafe-if-memory)

### Upcoming Planned Features
* Typed Fragments (about 2/3 way to fully verifiable semantics)
* Language Standard v1.0 (finally some stable interfaces like libc compatible malloc etc.)
* Linear Garbage Collection
* Closures with auto GC
