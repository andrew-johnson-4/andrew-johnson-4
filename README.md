$$greedy \ infer \quad \frac{f:A \to B \quad f:B \to C}{f:A \to C}$$

$$cannot \ determine \ color \quad \frac{f:A \to B \quad f:B \to C \quad f:A \to C}{\bot}$$


 Combination         | Result                                  |
---------------------|-----------------------------------------|
 Neither             | Inference is dumb                       |
 Greedy              | Inference is maybe too smart            |
 ColorBlind          | Inference is maybe too conservative     |
 Greedy + ColorBlind | Inference sometimes bottoms out         |
