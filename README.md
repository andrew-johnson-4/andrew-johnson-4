### Request for Comment

If you feel like contributing to either LM or LSTS it would be enormously helpful to have anyone simply read a bit and ask a question. 
The projects are starting to grow to a size where it is hard to understand where a curious learner might get stuck.
Different people have different backgrounds so it takes all shapes and sizes.
Everyone is welcome, though I fear that the learning curves are still very steep.
