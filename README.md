“I am afraid sometimes that what I say is not what others hear, and that what I mean is not what others understand.”

## My TODO List

1. Finish [PunC](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/PunCalculus) typechecking to at least a point where it can verify LSTS programs
2. Finish LambdaMountain parsing to provide a declarative parsing framework for both LSTS and LM programs
3. Rewrite LSTS in LM with PunC verification
