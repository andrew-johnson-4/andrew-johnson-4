# Hi, I'm Andrew Johnson ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=andrew-johnson-4)

## Bulletin

* [PunC 1.0 Announcement](https://medium.com/@andrew_johnson_4/project-milestone-punc-1-0-and-lm-specifications-61602ca551fb)

## 10000 foot view

* [PunC](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/PunCalculus) is an Intermediate Representation
* [Relog](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/InPlace) is a Type System
* [Î»â˜¶](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/-) is a Compiler Backend
* [LSTS](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/LSTS) is a Compiler Frontend

## My TODO List

1. Implement a typed assembler for PunC
2. [Relog Standard Library](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/InPlace/issues/7) having good performance and good feature completeness
   * Making Relog powerful is useful because it allows side-effects to be well-typed (nominally)
3. Rewrite LSTS in LM with PunC/Relog verification
4. Optimize LSTS codegen for some common (CPU,GPU,Circuit Synthesis) use cases
5. Extend LSTS to support the full founding [Prelude](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/perplexity/blob/main/categorical_prelude.md)
