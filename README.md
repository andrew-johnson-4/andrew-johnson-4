# Hi, I'm Andrew Johnson ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=andrew-johnson-4)

I am currently working on a [proof assistant that is also a programming language](https://andrew-johnson-4.github.io/lsts-tutorial/index.html).

I program in Rust. I used to program in Python, C, and OCaml.

Programs are a form of communication. Programming Languages are first and foremost human languages.
