# Hi, I'm Andrew Johnson ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=andrew-johnson-4)

“My life depended on 150,000 pieces of equipment – each bought from the lowest bidder.”

Currently I am rewriting LSTS,
bootstrapped from Lambda Mountain,
to create a backend targeting LLVM IR directly.
I am [documenting the entire process on Medium](https://medium.com/@andrew_johnson_4/building-a-compiler-for-a-modern-functional-language-from-scratch-in-rust-part-1-parsing-d3dd1765ce1b).

Upcoming Features
- Simple Compiler
- Improved Type System
- Blame and Error Reporting
- Improved Compiler
