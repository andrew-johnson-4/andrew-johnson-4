> Even if full verification takes 100GB memory and 3 hours to run, it still might be worthwhile to do before a release.

### 2024 Roadmap (Working towards a verified kernel language)

* ✓ [1.0.0 Bootstrap Compiler](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/lambda-mountain/releases/tag/1.0.0) 🥳🎉🎁
* ✓ [1.17.0 Typed Fragments (about 2/3 way to fully verifiable semantics)](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/lambda-mountain/releases/tag/1.17.0)
* ✓ [1.18.0 C11 backend](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/lambda-mountain/releases/tag/1.18.0) 

### Reading

* [A Brief Introduction To Programming In LM](https://andrewjohnson4.substack.com/p/a-brief-introduction-to-programming)
* [Most Opcodes Are Typesafe If Memory Is Infinite](https://andrewjohnson4.substack.com/p/most-opcodes-are-typesafe-if-memory)

### Upcoming Planned Features
* Language Standard v1.0 (finally some stable interfaces like libc compatible malloc etc.)
* Linear Garbage Collection
