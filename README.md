## Bulletin

* [PunC 1.0 Announcement](https://medium.com/@andrew_johnson_4/project-milestone-punc-1-0-and-lm-specifications-61602ca551fb)

## My TODO List

1. Bootstrap tandem compilers: lm.c <-> c.lm
2. Rewrite LSTS in LM with PunC/Relog verification
3. Optimize LSTS codegen for some common (CPU,GPU,Circuit Synthesis) use cases
4. Extend LSTS to support the full founding [Prelude](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/perplexity/blob/main/categorical_prelude.md)
