> One of the most popular apps on phones are timers. The user already knows that they need to remember something, but they might need to be reminded. Assisted Reasoning is sort of like that: a tea timer for logic.

### 2024 Roadmap (Working towards a verified kernel language)

* ✓ [1.0.0 Bootstrap Compiler](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/-/releases/tag/1.0.0) 🥳🎉🎁
* ✓ [1.6.0 Production Compiler](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/-/releases/tag/1.6.0)
* ✓ [1.10.0 Ad-Hoc Specialization and Hygienic Macros](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/-/releases/tag/1.10.0)
* 100% compiled code when --strict mode is enabled
  * ✓ direct .text .data fragments (internal typing of fragments such as `U8+Reg8`)
  * ✓ default instruction set ( x86-64 )
  * ✓ Primitive Data Types (Int, Float, ...)
  * ✓ Operations on Primitive Types (+, -, /, ...)
  * ✓ Stack Variables are Just Fragments Too (Offset -> Fragment -> Destination)
  * Basic Data Structures: Structs, Tagged Unions
  * Specialized Explicit Context: Typesafe Register Allocation, Stack State, Heap State
  * Container Types
  * Arbitrary Custom Data Structures (raw data fragment based definitions)
  * Arbitrary Custom Code Structures (raw code fragment based definitions)
  * Remove all S-Expression default types from compiler (enforce with --strict)
  * Named Accessors for Struct Types (.offset:Expr->Int), (set.offset:(Expr,Int)->Nil) (different functions have different calling conventions)
  * ✓ benchmark vs some other compilers (OCaml, Rust, C) 📈📈📈
  * don't generate code for unused functions
* Garbage Collection
  * [Statically Unknown Size Allocator](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/lm_skip_list_atom_allocator) (defined as a custom data structure, i.e library not intrinsic)
  * [Statically Known Size Allocator](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/lm_generational_cons_allocator) (defined as a custom data structure, i.e. library not instrinsic)

### Benchmarks are silly but we still do them
