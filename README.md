> Once a bug has been documented, it becomes a feature.

### LSTS Code Examples

* [LSTS Tokenizer](https://andrewjohnson4.substack.com/p/lsts-pearl-writing-a-tokenizer)
* [Propositional Types, Corollaries, and Quick-Props]((https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/LSTS/wiki/Propositional-Types)
* [Advanced Topics: Phi Types](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/LSTS/wiki/Phi-Types)

### 2024 Roadmap (Working towards a verified kernel language)

* ‚úì [1.0.0 Bootstrap Compiler](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/lambda-mountain/releases/tag/1.0.0) ü•≥üéâüéÅ
* ‚úì [1.18.0 ISO C 2011 backend, `import stdlib.h;` just works.](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/lambda-mountain/releases/tag/1.18.0)
* ‚úì [1.19.0 Basic support for LSTS syntax](https://github.com/andrew-johnson-4/lambda-mountain/releases/tag/1.19.1) 

### Reading

* [Most Opcodes Are Typesafe If Memory Is Infinite](https://andrewjohnson4.substack.com/p/most-opcodes-are-typesafe-if-memory)
* [Comparing Haskell Type Classes to Simple Specialization](https://andrewjohnson4.substack.com/p/comparing-haskell-type-classes-to)
* [What is the difference between a C String, a Smart String, and a Rope?](https://andrewjohnson4.substack.com/p/what-is-the-different-between-a-c)

### Upcoming Planned Features
* rewrite compiler internals in LSTS (focus on how things should be, rather than how things are)
  * some of the internal APIs can be stabilized, just written with a different syntax
* Language Standard v1.0
* Linear Garbage Collection
* Representation Selection for Closures with auto GC
* Correctness Proofs with Coq (100% verifiable semantics)
